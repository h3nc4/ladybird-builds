# Ladybird Builds

Unofficial packages of the [Ladybird](https://ladybird.org) browser, built every week from upstream `master`. Ladybird doesn't publish binaries of its own before its alpha, and this repository fills that gap.

## Install

Each release is tagged with the upstream commit date and short hash, such as `20261005.gitfc5e9c7`, and carries one file per system.

| System | File |
| --- | --- |
| Debian sid | `ladybird_0~<date>.git<hash>+sid_amd64.deb` |
| Ubuntu 26.04 | `ladybird_0~<date>.git<hash>+ubuntu26.04_amd64.deb` |
| Any other x86-64 Linux with glibc 2.39 or newer | `Ladybird-<date>.git<hash>-x86_64.AppImage` |

On Debian sid:

```sh
gh release download --repo h3nc4/ladybird-builds --pattern '*+sid_amd64.deb'
sudo apt install ./ladybird_*+sid_amd64.deb
```

On Ubuntu 26.04, swap `+sid` for `+ubuntu26.04` in both lines.

Anywhere else:

```sh
gh release download --repo h3nc4/ladybird-builds --pattern '*.AppImage'
chmod +x Ladybird-*.AppImage
./Ladybird-*.AppImage
```

The AppImage needs these from the system. Release `20261005.git4b63acc` was run against them on Ubuntu 24.04 and Debian 13.

| Requirement | Check |
| --- | --- |
| glibc 2.39 or newer | `ldd --version` |
| libstdc++ from GCC 13 or newer | `strings "$(ldconfig -p \| awk '/libstdc\+\+\.so\.6 .*x86-64/{print $NF; exit}')" \| grep -x GLIBCXX_3.4.32` |
| a setuid `fusermount3` or `fusermount`, of any version | `command -v fusermount3 fusermount` |
| `libOpenGL.so.0` from libglvnd, packaged as `libopengl0` on Debian and Ubuntu | `ldconfig -p \| grep libOpenGL.so.0` |
| fontconfig, freetype, X11, xcb, wayland-client and zlib | present on any desktop install |

Without FUSE, `./Ladybird-*.AppImage --appimage-extract-and-run` unpacks the image to a temporary directory and runs it from there.

## Before installing

The build targets x86-64-v3, the level that adds AVX2. Intel Haswell and AMD Excavator were the first processors with it. An older CPU stops the browser with an illegal instruction. Check with `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 --help | grep x86-64-v3`, which prints `supported` beside it on a capable machine.

The `.deb` depends on the exact Qt release it was built against, because Ladybird uses Qt's private API. When the distribution moves to a newer Qt, apt holds Qt back or offers to remove `ladybird` until the next weekly build catches up.

Ladybird itself is pre-alpha. Expect sites to break and the browser to crash.

## How it builds

Each `<target>.Dockerfile` describes a build environment, with toolchain and Qt installed and the build itself left to the scripts. `scripts/build.sh` compiles upstream's `Distribution` preset, which links every dependency statically except Qt and the system libraries, targets the x86-64-v3 baseline and skips link-time optimisation. `scripts/deb.sh` and `scripts/appimage.sh` then package the result. The AppImage is built on Debian 13 and bundles Qt 6.11 from the Qt online archive, since Ladybird needs Qt 6.10 or newer.

The `Release` workflow runs every Monday at 06:00 UTC and skips a commit already released. For each target, one job builds the vcpkg dependencies, and 4 runners then compile a quarter of the object files apiece into ccache stores uploaded as artifacts. A last job merges those stores and runs the full build, where every compile is a cache hit and only linking and packaging remain. The vcpkg cache is keyed on upstream's `vcpkg.json` and the Dockerfile, so a new Ladybird commit reuses last week's dependencies. The ccache store is saved per run and restored by the next one. Both are saved even when a job runs out of time, and the next run resumes from that point.

To build the Debian package on a local machine:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird src
docker build -t ladybird-debian -f debian.Dockerfile \
  --build-arg RUST_TOOLCHAIN="$(sed -n 's/^channel = "\(.*\)"/\1/p' src/rust-toolchain.toml)" .
docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/w" ladybird-debian scripts/build.sh /w/src /w/root
docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/w" ladybird-debian scripts/deb.sh /w/src /w/root /w/dist sid
```

The package is written to `dist/`, owned by root.
